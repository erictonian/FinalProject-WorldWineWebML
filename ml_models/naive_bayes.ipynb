       " \"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.\",\n",
       " 'Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.',\n",
       " 'Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.',\n",
       " 'Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.',\n",
       " \"Zesty orange peels and apple notes abound in this sprightly, mineral-toned Riesling. Off dry on the palate, yet racy and lean, it's a refreshing, easy quaffer with wide appeal.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.',\n",
       " 'A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.',\n",
       " 'Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.',\n",
       " 'Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins.',\n",
       " 'Rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. Made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " 'This shows a tart, green gooseberry flavor that is similar to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Other notes include tropical fruit, orange and honey. Unoaked, with a splash of Muscat, this has commendable dryness and acidity.',\n",
       " 'As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.',\n",
       " 'This concentrated Cabernet offers aromas of cured meat, dried fruit and rosemary. Barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce flavors give the wine a bold, chewy feel.',\n",

       " \"The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability. It's dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.\",\n",
       " 'Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. The texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish. An eccentric blend of 50% Tannat, 35% Petit Verdot and 15% Pinotage.',\n",
       " 'This is a sweet wine with flavors of white sugar, orange, honey and vanilla, all brightened by crisp acidity.',\n",
       " 'This bottling resembles the New Zealand paradigm of Sauvignon Blanc, bearing aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit and kiwi; a sprinkling of graham cracker adds interest. The wine hits the palate like a fleshy fist, with an intense, grassy gooseberry flavor that provides plenty of punch. Pair with apricot-glazed roasted chicken.',\n",
       " \"This shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. The mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.\",\n",
       " 'This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes.',\n",
       " 'Lightly herbal strawberry and raspberry aromas are authentic and fresh. On the palate, this is light and juicy, with snappy, lean flavors of red fruit and dry spice. The finish is dry and oaky.',\n",
       " 'Syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. Ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather.',\n",
       " 'There are intriguing touches to the nose of this bottling, with jasmine, sea salt, wet hay, quinine and rainy sidewalk. The structure on the sip is quite delicate, with golden apple and honey flavors.',\n",
       " \"From the warm 2015 vintage, this is a soft and fruity wine. It's open with broad white fruit flavors, the acidity lighter than usual for Chablis, giving it a particularly ripe character. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"This soft, rounded wine is ripe with generous pear and melon flavors. It's easy and ready to drink young for its smooth, attractively ripe character.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. The plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes.',\n",
       " \"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted.',\n",
       " \"Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds.\",\n",
       " \"Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. Tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness.\",\n",
       " 'This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.',\n",
       " \"Earthy pollen and mineral notes lend a savory tone to this medium-sweet Riesling. It's soft and slightly pulpy, intensified by overripe tangerine and stone fruit flavors. Drink now through 2018.\",\n",
       " 'This medium-bodied Chardonnay features aromas of pineapple and roasted cashew. Similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Pronounced dust, pollen and earth tones lend savoriness to this otherwise citrusy wine. Racy acidity and fresh tangerine and lemon flavors turn herbal on the finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This blend of Sangiovese, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and other varieties plays well to type. It shows a wealth of ripe, dusty black fruit that's richly round and soft on the palate, approachable and lightly oaked.\",\n",
       " 'Freshness characterizes the nose: green pear, ivy leaves and citrus notes play on nose and palate. This is light footed, easy drinking and charming. Drink soon while flavors are fresh.',\n",
       " 'A wisp of bramble extends a savory tone from nose to finish on this otherwise bright bristling wine. Delicate honey tones register as off dry on the palate but balance neatly alongside flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears. The finish is marked by a touch of pencil lead. Drink now through 2020.',\n",
       " \"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate. With a core of tobacco, tar and graphite, it complements the fruity with the savory, ending simply and elegantly.\",\n",
       " 'Dusty mineral, smoke and struck flint lend a savory tone to this lean light-bodied Riesling. Off dry in style, the palate offers delicately concentrated flavors of red apple and nectarine off set by tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2021.',\n",
       " 'Intensely smoky tones of struck flint and ash extend throughout this otherwise bright nimble Riesling. The palate boasts freshly pressed apple and pear flavors accentuated by zippy lemon-lime acidity. Drink now through 2021.',\n",
       " 'A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition, with roundness along the edges of the palate. Apple and nectarine flavors are lightly oaked and salty, while this holds form on a high-acid finish.',\n",
       " 'Made with 65% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and thyme. The easygoing palate delivers black cherry and cinnamon alongside smooth tannins.',\n",
       " 'A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese, this pleasant red has aromas of dark-skinned fruit, toast and a whiff of espresso. The light-bodied, straightforward palate offers cherry, red currant and a hint of light spice alongside zesty acidity and polished tannins.',\n",
       " 'An easy-drinking blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of red berry, toast, herb and roasted coffee bean. The soft palate offers black cherry, mocha and a hint of coffee alongside bright acidity and silky tannins. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'This 100% varietal wine opens in a heady aroma of leather pouch, clove and marshmallow. Both herbaceous and tannic, it begs for more time in the bottle or substantial swirling in the glass.',\n",
       " 'Made with 90% Merlot and 10% Alicante, this easygoing red opens with delicate aromas suggesting red currant and baking spice. The straightforward palate delivers red plum and clove alongside soft tannins. Enjoy soon.',\n",
       " 'Tar, dried meat, olallieberry and sharp cedar aromas show on this blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon and 49% Merlot. Dried strawberries and plums mix with thyme and dried rose petals on the palate.',\n",
       " \"Poached pears, yellow apples and a touch of butter show on the classic nose of this Chardonnay that holds to steely frame. Very sharp acidity kicks off the sip, where Pink Lady apples and warm vanilla surround a tight minerality. It's both sharp and slightly sweet.\",\n",
       " 'Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here. There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches.',\n",
       " 'A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese, this offers aromas of black currant, caramel and mocha. The dense palate delivers toast, leather and cedar alongside teeth-coating tannins that grip the finish.',\n",
       " \"Medium-gold in color. Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey. On the palate it is racy, taut and focused full of well defined ripe succulent citrus and stone fruit. Rich, viscous texture perfectly balanced by the wine's crispness and almost steely minerality. Very long, juicy, lingering finish.\",\n",
       " 'The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.',\n",
       " 'This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.',\n",
       " 'Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.',\n",
       " 'A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark it´s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits.',\n",
       " 'A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor. This is an impressive wine, the flagship red from this estate founded by Spatz Sperling over 30 years ago.',\n",
       " \"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.\",\n",
       " \"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now–2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.\",\n",
       " 'A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.',\n",
       " 'Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023.',\n",
       " 'Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.',\n",
       " \"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.\",\n",
       " \"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.\",\n",
       " 'Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019.',\n",
       " 'This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla.',\n",
       " 'From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2027.',\n",
       " \"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.\",\n",
       " \"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.\",\n",
       " 'A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes.',\n",
       " \"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.',\n",
       " 'Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022.',\n",
       " \"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.\",\n",
       " \"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.\",\n",
       " 'Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years.',\n",
       " 'Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019.',\n",
       " 'This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.',\n",
       " \"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.\",\n",
       " 'Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods.',\n",
       " \"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.\",\n",
       " \"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.\",\n",
       " 'The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.',\n",
       " \"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.\",\n",
       " \"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.\",\n",
       " 'This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.\",\n",
       " \"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.\",\n",
       " 'Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.',\n",
       " 'Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in.',\n",
       " \"From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling—an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.\",\n",
       " \"Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.\",\n",

Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices.

       " \"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'The lightest in a range of Grüner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.',\n",
       " \"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.\",\n",
       " \"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.\",\n",

       " 'One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Grüner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine apéritif or seafood partner. Screwcap.',\n",
       " \"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.\",\n",
       " \"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.\",\n",
       " 'For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This rosé, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel.',\n",

Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex.',\n",
       " \"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit.

       " \"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine.

       " 'This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth.',\n",
       " 'Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée.',\n",
       " 'From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " 'Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.',\n",
       " \"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.\",\n",
       " \"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.\",\n",
       " 'More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing.',\n",
       " \"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant.\",\n",
       " \"All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvée. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.\",\n",
       " 'Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.',\n",
       " \"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.\",\n",
       " 'From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor.',\n",
       " 'From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.',\n",
       " 'Old-vine Pinot Noir has produced a rich structured wood-aged wine. With its opulent texture and ripe full-bodied cherries and red plums, the wine is poised and generous. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.',\n",
       " \"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the pièce de résistance.\",\n",
       " \"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.\",\n",
       " 'Earthy red-fruit aromas come with hints of olive, herbs and spice. The mouthfeel on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Carmenère is racy and layered. Flavors of herbal berry and spice finish long. Drink through 2018.',\n",
       " 'Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option.',\n",
       " 'Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016.',\n",
       " \"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.\",\n",
       " 'With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality.',\n",
       " \"This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rhône. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine.

       " 'Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins.',\n",

       " \"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.',\n",
       " 'This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.',\n",
       " 'Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.',\n",

       " 'Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.',\n",
       " 'This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.',\n",

The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.\",\n",
       " \"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade.\",\n",
       " \"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.\",\n",
       " \"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua.

       " 'With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.',\n",
       " 'Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.',\n",
       " 'A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.',\n",

       " 'Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down.',\n",

       " \"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.\",\n",
       " \"Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.\",\n",
       " 'Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish.

Give it 5–6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.\",\n",
       " 'Aromatic hints of new wood translate onto the smooth palate. It has smoke and black currant flavors, with tannins that are already well integrated. Attractive acidity gives this a final lift. Keep it for 5–6 years.',\n",
       " 'The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant. Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013–2018.',\n",
       " \"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee.

       " \"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.\",\n",
       " 'A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.',\n",
       " 'A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style.',\n",
       " 'A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis.

Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.',\n",

This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity.',\n",

       " 'A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of Château Figeac. The wine is perfumed with new wood and sweet fruits, delicious black currant flavors giving both ripeness and freshness. The wine has weight and impressive density. A star of the vintage.',\n",

It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.\",\n",
       " 'The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.',\n",

Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.\",\n",
       " 'Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine.',\n",

       " \"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit.

       " \"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.\",\n",
       " 'Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2–4 years.',\n",
       " \"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.\",\n",
       " \"This is a soft, appealing Chardonnay layered with toasted marshmallow and superripe peach. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusy—almost metallic—on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Fine, rich black-fruit flavors give this wine a sense of ripeness, openness and generosity. The wood and fruit balance is already fine, showing that it will be ready to drink this year.',\n",
       " \"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish.\",\n",
       " \"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up.\",\n",
       " 'This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel.',\n",
       " 'A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.',\n",
       " 'Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish.',\n",
       " \"Ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft texture mark this wine. It's full, ripe and lightly structured. An attractive wine for its black fruit and forward character. Drink in 2–4 years.\",\n",
       " 'Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture. At the end, the fragrant acidity shines. Screwcap.',\n",
       " 'Not the richest Chardonnay ever, but it has complex notes of citrus, apple, nectarine and tropical fruits, with kisses of vanilla and cream. Acidity gives it elegant brightness.',\n",
       " 'This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious.\",\n",
       " 'Scratchy berry aromas come with a hint of sweet-smelling plastic, but overall this bargain-priced Cab is good and welcoming. The palate has a pure, medium-bodied feel, while flavors of baked berry, cassis and chocolate finish with a mocha taste and mild heat.',\n",
       " 'This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.',\n",
       " \"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.\",\n",
       " \"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.\",\n",
       " 'Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.',\n",
       " 'On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.',\n",
       " 'Yogev, meaning “tiller of the soil,” is a friendly and easy-pleasing wine, with direct notes of cherry skins, fresh cassis and black currant leaf. Medium weight, with moderate acidity, fine tannins and a clean, fruit-driven finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.\",\n",
       " 'This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak.',\n",
       " 'The light-framed aromas of strawberry and raspberry are clean and citrusy. The palate on this wine made by the Chablis-based producer Laroche is crisp, tangy and juicy, with flavors of raspberry and cranberry that are fresh and tight. A clean, honest Pinot to enjoy now.',\n",
       " \"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering.\",\n",
       " 'Cherry and blackberry notes dominate this ripe, full wine. It has a smoky, toasty character that lends good balance and aging potential. The estate is planted with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " 'Tough tannins set the scene for this firm and extracted wine, giving it a smokiness and a touch of bitter fruit. However, the wine has the weight to support the tannins, and it hints at future juicy fruit. Keep this for at least five years.',\n",
       " 'Made from Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio, this shows bright berry aromas of blackberry and cassis, with cola, dried ginger and polished mineral notes. The mouthfeel is clean and bright, with a touch of chopped mint.',\n",
       " \"This is the most complete of the four Prince Hill clonal selection bottlings. It has flavors of cherry, Dr. Pepper, cherry candy and a hint of incense. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking wine best consumed while still young.\",\n",
       " \"This best-of-barrels Chardonnay is oaky, offering waves of butterscotch and buttered toast that dominate the tart underlying flavors of pineapple and lime. It's certainly rich and well-structured, but quite oaky.\",\n",
       " \"Soft, sweet and appealing, this has raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with an oak-influenced note of buttered toast. It's an easy, gentle wine, with some real depth and complexity.\",\n",
       " 'This smells deep and bass-like, with resonating notes of honeyed white currant, spiced breakfast toast and apricot preserves, accented with touches of caramel and toasted nut. It feels round, rich and opulent, with a nice lift of acids that give the wine some spring.',\n",
       " 'This Syrah offers bright tones of leather, cured meat and blackberry. Smooth and long-lasting, the palate boasts loads of bright berries.',\n",
       " 'An exotic, spicy Pinot Noir, this is medium-bodied and crisp, with complex cranberry, raspberry, red licorice and smoky sandalwood flavors. Drink this dry, silky effort now.',\n",
       " 'Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish.',\n",
       " 'This is serviceable but rather bland, with a dusting of cinnamon spice and simple, tart fruit.',\n",
       " 'A lightly fruity wine that has a soft texture, gentle acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. It is ready to drink with its steely backbone well enmeshed in the fruitiness.',\n",
       " 'Gritty, roasted berry aromas are rubbery and hint at Band-Aids. In the mouth, this is O.K. in feel, albeit a bit jammy and thick. Short, generic berry flavors come with minty accents and some green on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Lemon curd and artificial butter show on the nose and palate, with underripe peach adding verve to a creamy body.',\n",
       " 'This full-throttle, oaky Chardonnay features an intriguingly curious mix of corn nuts, diesel and marijuana on the nose. The corresponding layers of flavor are straightforward and simple.',\n",
       " 'Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere. Thin, dilute, barely ripe strawberry fruit vanishes quickly once in the mouth, and there is little trace of any barrel flavors from aging in 20% new French oak.',\n",
       " 'Dusty aromas of red cherry are muddled by oaky notes of plastic and latex. A jumpy, bright palate is rudimentary, as are lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors. A fresh, dry, basic finish seems appropriate.',\n",
       " \"Dry, spicy aromas aren't overly ripe or expressive. In the mouth, this basic Cab is raw, racy and spiky in feel. Flavors of herbal red-berry fruits are leafy, while finishing flavors of carob and pepper register as adequate.\",\n",
       " 'Underripe fruit seems more sour than anything. Some bitter, stemmy flavors creep into the finish.',\n",
       " 'This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Amid the blackberry and asphalt tones, this has a funky rubber twist on the nose. The bottling is a side label of Avelina, founded by former Oreana Winery owner Christian Garvin. It's tart and sour on the palate, with dried raspberries and a bit more funk.\",\n",
       " \"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines. It's high in acidity, with a silky mouthfeel. A little rustic, it shows cherry skin, tobacco and white pepper flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Ready for drinking now with its raspberries, currants, persimmons and oak. The acidity is bright, and the finish is clean and spicy. Pair now with lamb dishes.',\n",
       " \"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this 100% varietal wine doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened but still offers plenty of enjoyment with its savory notes of leafy herbs, olive and cherry. It's elegant in its styling with a fresh feel and a cinnamon-speckled finish.\",\n",
       " \"Sourced from a single vineyard, this spent 17 months in French oak, 38% new. It's light and spicy, with pleasant fruit flavors of apple and pear.\",\n",
       " 'Reedy berry aromas mixed with herbal notes set up a chunky, voluminous palate. Spicy flavors of olive, green herbs, tobacco and oak run alongside berry and plum fruit. On the finish, a resiny oak flavor and herbal notes meld then fade away. This is 55% Carmenère, 30% Petit Verdot and 15% Syrah.',\n",
       " 'With touches of vanilla and caramel as well as ripe yellow fruits, this is a warm, generous Chardonnay. It has freshness from the citrus edge and a soft texture. Straightforward, it is an open and ready-to-drink wine.',\n",
       " 'A familiar Chilean mix of berry, plum, spice and herbal aromas feed into a lifted but prickly palate that supports roasted, earthy flavors of berry, cassis and olive. A racy, slightly rough finish is home to spicy, chocolaty flavors on top of residual herbal berry.',\n",
       " \"A fifty-fifty blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this densely concentrated wine has aromas that suggest underbrush, wet leaves, black berries and prune. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry, raisin, black pepper, espresso, bitter dark chocolate and a sugary vanilla note alongside solid tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.\",\n",
       " 'With brisk acidity, a bone-dry finish and some dusty tannins, this is an interesting Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and cherry jam, pomegranate and cranberry flavors that are ready to drink now.',\n",
       " \"Dry and tannic, this 100% Cab has flavors of herbs, blackberries and tea. It's a tough wine not showing generosity now. You can age for a couple years, but the tannins will outlast the fruit.\",\n",
       " 'A dense and rich, jammy Merlot that is full of black fruit and has an ultra-ripe feel. It is hardly Bordeaux, but it does hold attraction with its rich, full fruits and dense tannins. A smoke and bitter chocolate aftertaste suggests some firm extraction.',\n",
       " 'Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Now–2015.',\n",
       " 'Very rich in texture while also balanced, this is a wine that shows extreme concentration—honey, yellow fruits and final sugar all wrapped in lively acidity.',\n",
       " 'Intense acidity, with the sweetness held in check by a bright, crisp character. Rich honey is balanced by an exquisite freshness, lightly perfumed, so clean and clear in final taste.',\n",
       " 'Both crisp and rich, a magical combination with beautiful acidity, light currants, the whole wine infused with honey. The final acidity leaves a long-lasting aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'A beautifully accessible wine, polished, pretty and likeable now for its gentle texture and silky tannins. The sweet cherry and raspberry fruit is encircled with a coat of fancy smoked oak. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is balanced enough to gain bottle complexity for a decade.',\n",
       " \"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling.\",\n",
       " \"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge. The disgorgement date is indicated on the bottle. Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging.\",\n",
       " \"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down.\",\n",
       " 'A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar. Astringent now, it has a deep core of black currants and cedar, with the polished tannins that Napa so easily crafts. Try between 2010–2012.',\n",
       " 'Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth. Aging for 18 months in new French oak brings in coffee and chocolate, balanced and subtly displayed. Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.',\n",
       " 'A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.',\n",
       " 'Elegantly structured, with firm tannins, a silky texture and a fine balance of fruit, acidity and oak. Shows cherry, red currant, cola and sandalwood flavors that are delicious, but those tannins close in on the finish, making the wine hard. Try after 2011.',\n",
       " 'A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins. There is a stalky element of black currant skins which adds to the sensation of dryness, but there is also a more mouthfilling character of black plum juice to give the wine a final roundness.',\n",
       " \"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita.\",\n",
       " \"Lamorèmio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry. You'll also get a touch of caper or green olive that rides on the heels of the wine's smooth, supple mouthfeel.\",\n",
       " 'A richly Merlot wine, soft, ripe, packed with black jelly flavors, sweet acidity and generous balanced tannins. The flavors come together in a balanced, rich way. An attractive wine, ready to drink now.',\n",
       " \"Opulence is the reserve Syrah, a firm and juicy wine with dark, smoky, wild berry flavors. It's gamy and brambly, chewy and tart, and it has the length and polish to sustain your interest through glass after glass.\",\n",
       " \"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power. Pineapple crème brûlée, spicy green apple butter, ripe pear, Asian spices and smoky oak are the flavors, backed with firm acidity.',\n",
       " 'Young and fresh in citrusy acidity, with forward fruit flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, bacon and sweet oak. Good and dry and silky, but immature.',\n",
       " \"This is an example of a lighter, drier style of Cabernet that maintains great elegance and charm. It's very dry, showing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and brightened with crispness. Best now–2011.\",\n",
