## Project Goal
Our goal is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Machine Learning in order to predict a number of dependent variables (price, points, country, varietal) from the description of the wine. In order to do this we will take the following steps:
  1) ETL -- use a combination of existing data from WineEnthusiast and newly scrapped data to create a large enough dataset to train the model.
  2) Textual Analysis -- analyze the wine desriptions that will make up our explanatory variable by exploring word counts, performing sentiment analysis, and looking for word associations with word2vec.
  3) Pre-processing and Model selection -- prepare data through removal of stop words, tokenization, vectorization, over/under sampling. Then choose variety of models for each of our dependent variables with best theoretical fit, train, test, compare!

## Presentation
Intro - Us, Topic, Goal *Eric T*  
Data - Source, Scrape (ETL) *Ryan*  
Desc. Analysis - Description, Sentiment, word2vec *Ryan*   
ML Models - Price/Points, Variety, Country; how we decided to filter data, what methods did we need to use, why did we pick               this/these models *Eric&Eric*   
Conclusion- what we found (is it useful?), what can we build off of this, what we learned *All*  

## Data Source
1) Wine Review Dataset- 180k+ wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
2) Our own scrapping of the same source: https://winemag.com/
