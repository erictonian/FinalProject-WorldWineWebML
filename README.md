## (Potential) Project Goals
1) Create an ML app with NLP to give users wine recommendations based upon either: flavor profiles, food pairings, or other wines.
(or)
2) Create an ML app with CNN that will analyze the 'look' of a wine label and predict: price, rating, region, type, etc. Bonus: See if it can produce an 'image' of a wine label given a classification (price, rating, etc.).

## (Potential) Data Sources
1) Wine Review Dataset- 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
2) Create our own scraper of Vivino.com for wine data including: image, price, rating, region, type, etc..
